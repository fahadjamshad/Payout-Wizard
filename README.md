### Mock API Settings

The mock API can be configured in `src/services/payoutApi.ts`:

```typescript
// Adjust delay for testing
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

// Modify validation rules
if (payoutData.amount > 1000000) {
  errors.push("Amount cannot exceed $1,000,000");
}
```

### Validation Rules

Validation rules are defined in `src/utils/validation.ts`:

- Amount: $0.01 - $1,000,000
- Email: Valid email format
- Phone: International format support
- Bank Account: 8-17 digit account numbers, 9-digit routing numbers
- Crypto: Bitcoin and Ethereum address validation

## 🧪 Testing
