## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Focus Management

```typescript
// Focus trap implementation
const useFocusTrap = (isActive: boolean) => {
  // Traps focus within wizard container
  // Handles Tab and Shift+Tab navigation
  // Focuses first element when activated
};
```

### ARIA Implementation

```html
<!-- Form field with proper ARIA attributes -->
<input
  type="email"
  id="email"
  name="email"
  aria-describedby="email-error email-help"
  aria-invalid="true"
  aria-required="true"
/>
<div id="email-error" role="alert">Error message</div>
<div id="email-help">Help text</div>
```

### Screen Reader Announcements

```typescript
// Announce step changes to screen readers
useEffect(() => {
  const stepTitle = steps.find((step) => step.id === currentStep)?.title || "";
  announceToScreenReader(`Step ${currentStep} of ${totalSteps}: ${stepTitle}`);
}, [currentStep, totalSteps]);
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations
